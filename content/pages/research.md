### Master's degree
My research topic is network analysis of cancer genetics. (Working in Progress)


### Chinese Search (Intern at Pinkoi)
I tweaked the Chinese product search system based on ElasticSearch. Chinese segmentation, unlike English or many other languages whose words are split by space, is a nontrivial task. I optimized the segmentation look-up dictionary.

On top of ElasticSearch, an idea of semantic search using Word2Vec was proposed and initially developed. So event if the query term does not match products of interest by words, they may be semantically similar. For example, slim-fit pants, skinny jeans, and tight pants are the similar concepts. (NOTE: the implementation is for Chinese).
