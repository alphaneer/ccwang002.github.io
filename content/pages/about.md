Hi, I'm Liang Bo Wang (王亮博). Most people call me 亮亮 (Liang-liang, or liang<sup>2</sup>).

I'm a master student in Bioinfo, National Taiwan University. My previous interns include Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and [Pinkoi]. I live in Taipei, Taiwan.

My CV is [here](/CV.pdf) (a PDF file).


### Research
My research topic is network analysis of cancer genetics. You can find more about my research at its [specific page][research].


### Coding
I'm active in Taipei Python and R meetups. Also I like to give talks. The full talk list is [here][talks].

I speak fluent Python (especially 3.x) and R. My daily research relies on Python scientific computing stack, such as Numpy, pandas, Jupyter(IPython), matplotlib, and Cython. For statistics, I use R more frequently and communicate between Python and R using rpy2.

During my master training, intern, and my free time, I've written a few websites based on Python web frameworks, including Django, Flask, and Bottle. But I won't claim I know much about web development. See [my github] for proof.


### Contact me
Contacting me through either Twitter DM or email is fine. If private info included, my public PGP key is [`B233544E`](/B233544E.pub.asc) and its fingerprint is:

```
6ECD C5B8 235C D44D 2471 866E 30A4 5011 B233 544E
```


### How to pronounce my nickname?
亮亮 is composed of single character, **亮**, repeated two times with same pronunciation, *lia-ng*. Mind the pitch because in Chinese different pitches have different meanings. The pitch is similar to how people say *shoot!*.

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E4%BA%AE%E4%BA%AE) gives an acceptable pronunciation. However, I'd like to recommend an online dictionary, [moedict (萌典)](https://www.moedict.tw/%E4%BA%AE), for its accurate pronunciation and thorough content.

**亮** means *bright* in Chinese.


### How to pronounce my name?
I'll assume you've already known how to say my nickname, because my full name, 王亮博, should be two levels harder :)

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) still does an acceptable job here. Also, following [the link](https://www.moedict.tw/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) to moedict, click on each character will lead you to their definition pages, where their meaning and pronunciation can be found.

王亮博 maps to Wang / Liang / Bo word-by-word. Last name (王) is first stated in Chinese but when written in English, it follows the common English nomenclature.
