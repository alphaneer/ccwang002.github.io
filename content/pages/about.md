Hi, I'm Liang-Bo Wang（王亮博）. Most people call me 亮亮 (or liang<sup>2</sup>, pronounced as Liang-liang). In the United States, people call me Bobo since it is easier to pronunce :)

I'm studying Computational and Systems Biology as a Ph.D. student in Washington University in St. Louis. My graduate advisor is [Prof. Li Ding][dinglab]. My previous interns include Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and [Pinkoi]. I grew up in Taipei, Taiwan.

You can find my CV [here](/CV.pdf).

### Programming (communities)
Before studying in St. Louis, I was active in Taipei Python and R meetups and enjoyed giving talks. The full talk list can be found [here][talks].

I speak fluent Python (especially 3.x) and R. My daily research relies on Python scientific computing stack, such as Numpy, pandas, Jupyter(IPython), matplotlib, and Cython. For statistics, I use R more frequently and communicate between Python and R using rpy2.

During my master's training, intern, and my free time, I've written a few websites based on Python web frameworks, including Django, Flask, and Bottle. But I won't claim I know much about web development. See [my github] for proof.

### How to pronounce my nickname?
亮亮 is composed of single character, **亮**, repeated two times with same pronunciation, *lia-ng*. Mind the pitch because in Chinese different pitches have different meanings. The pitch is similar to how people say *shoot!*.

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E4%BA%AE%E4%BA%AE) gives an acceptable pronunciation. However, I'd like to recommend an online dictionary, [moedict (萌典)](https://www.moedict.tw/%E4%BA%AE), for its accurate pronunciation and thorough content.

**亮** means *bright* in Chinese.


### How to pronounce my name?
I'll assume you've already known how to say my nickname, because my full name, 王亮博, should be two levels harder :)

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) still does an acceptable job here. Also, following [the link](https://www.moedict.tw/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) to moedict, click on each character will lead you to their definition pages, where their meaning and pronunciation can be found.

王亮博 maps to Wang / Liang / Bo word-by-word. Last name (王) is first stated in Chinese but when written in English, it follows the common English nomenclature.
