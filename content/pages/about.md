Title: About me
---

Hi, I'm Liang Bo Wang (王亮博). Most people call me 亮亮 (Liang-liang, or liang<sup>2</sup>).

I'm a master student in Bioinfo, National Taiwan University. My previous interns include Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) and [Pinkoi].

[Pinkoi]: http://www.pinkoi.com/


### Research
My research topic is network analysis of cancer genetics.


### Open source coding
I'm active in Taipei Python and R meetups. Also I give talks at times. You can find more information [here](/pages/talks.html#talks).


### Contact me
Contact me through Twitter DM or email is fine. If private info included, my public PGP key is [`B233544E`](/B233544E.pub.asc) and its fingerprint is:

```
6ECD C5B8 235C D44D 2471 866E 30A4 5011 B233 544E
```


### How to pronounce my nickname?
亮亮 is composed of single character, **亮**, repeated two times with same pronunciation, *lia-ng*. Mind the pitch because in Chinese different pitches have different meanings. The pitch is similar to how people say *shoot!*.

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E4%BA%AE%E4%BA%AE) gives an acceptable pronunciation. However, I'd like to recommend an online dictionary, <a href="https://www.moedict.tw/%E4%BA%AE">moedict (萌典)</a>, for its accurate pronunciation and thorough content.

**亮** means *bright* in Chinese.

### How to pronounce my name?
I'll assume you've already known how to say my nickname, because my full name, 王亮博, should be two-level harder :)

[Google translator](https://translate.google.com.tw/?hl=zh-TW#zh-CN/zh-TW/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) still does an acceptable job here. Also, following [the link](https://www.moedict.tw/%E7%8E%8B%E4%BA%AE%E5%8D%9A) to moedict, click on each character will lead you to their definition pages, where their meaning and pronunciation can be found.

王亮博 maps to Wang / Liang / Bo word-by-word. Last name (王) is first stated in Chinese but when written in English, it follows the common English nomenclature.
